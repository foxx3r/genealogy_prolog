# genealogy_prolog
This is a project of genealogy in Prolog. It is a replacement of the genealogy made in datalog, 'cause it was giving me an error about unsafe function

To run, make sure that you have the swipl, and then, run:

`$ swipl genealogy.pl`

And then, test the functions specified in genealogy.pl. You can change the attributes if you want, but pay attention to add the gender for each person you will add :).
